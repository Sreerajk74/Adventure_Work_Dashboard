# Adventure_Work_Dashboard

🎯Objective: To contribute to business success by building a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, “Adventure Works Sales Performance,” focused on providing actionable insights into sales, customer behaviour, and product trends for informed decision-making.

📉Throughout the project, here are the key actions I undertook:
* ETL Process: Extracted data from Excel, performed transformations in Power Query to clean and refine the dataset, and loaded the data into a cohesive model with established relationships.
*	Advanced Analysis: Utilized DAX measures to analyze KPIs such as revenue, profit, orders, and return rates.
*	Interactive Dashboard Creation: Designed a dynamic dashboard featuring navigation buttons, slicers, and custom tooltips.
*	Visual Storytelling: Created visual elements like maps, charts, and matrices to showcase top products, revenue trends, and customer behavior.

Focused Pages:
-  Sales Overview: Highlighted KPIs, revenue trends, and top-performing categories.
-  Product Details: Explored monthly performance, profit vs. target trends, and price adjustments.
-  Customer Insights: Illustrated customer segmentation by income, occupation, and revenue contributions.
-  Geographical Trends: Analyzed total orders and sales across continents and countries.

📝Learnings: Strengthened my skills in ETL processes, time series analysis, interactive dashboard design, and data storytelling, driving business insights and success.
